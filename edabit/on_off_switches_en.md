# On/Off Switches

Create a function that returns how many possible outcomes can come from a certain number of switches (on / off). In other words, for a given number of switches, how many different combinations of **on** and **off** can we have?

## Examples

```C++
posCom(1) == 2;

posCom(3) == 8;

posCom(10) == 1024;
```

## Notes;

All numbers will be whole and positive.
