# Basic Calculator

Create a function that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator `+`, `-`, `/` or `*` and will perform a calculation with the given numbers.

## Examples

```C++
calculator(2, '+', 2) == 4;

calculator(2, '*', 2) == 4;

calculator(4, '/', 2) == 2;
```

## Notes

If the input tries to divide by 0, return `0`.
