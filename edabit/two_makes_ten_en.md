# Two Makes Ten

Create a function that takes two arguments. Both arguments are integers, `a` and `b`. Return `true` if one of them is `10` or if their sum is `10`.

## Examples

```C++
makesTen(9, 10) == true;

makesTen(9, 9) == false;

makesTen(1, 9) == true;
```

## Notes

* Don't forget to `return` the result.
