# Is The Number Less than or Equal to Zero?

Create a function that takes a number as its only argument and returns `true` if it's less than or equal to zero, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

```C++
lessThanOrEqualToZero(5) == false;

lessThanOrEqualToZero(0) == true;

lessThanOrEqualToZero(2) == false;
```

## Notes

* Don't forget to `return` the result.
