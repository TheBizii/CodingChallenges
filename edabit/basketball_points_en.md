# Basketball Points

You are counting points for a basketball game, given the amount of 3-pointers scored and 2-pointers scored, find the final points for the team and return that value (2-pointers scored, 3-pointers scored).

## Examples

```C++
points(1, 1) == 5;

points(7, 5) == 29;

points(38, 8) == 100;
```
