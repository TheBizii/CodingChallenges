# Return the Remainder from Two Numbers

There is a single operator in C++, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.

## Examples

```C++
remainder(1, 3) == 1;

remainder(3, 4) == 3;

remainder(-9, 45) == -9;

remainder(5, 5) == 0;
```

## Notes

* The tests only use positive and negative integers.
* Don't forget to `return` the result.
