# Return the Next Number from the Integer Passed

Create a function that takes a number as an argument, add one to the number, and return the result. 

## Examples
```C++
addition(0) == 1;
addition(9) == 10;
addition(-3) == -2;
```
## Notes

* Do not test for overflow.
* Don't forget to return the result.
