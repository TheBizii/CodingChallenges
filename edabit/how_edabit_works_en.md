# How Edabit Works

This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the **Code tab above** you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

```C++
bool returnTrue() {

}
```

All you have to do is type `return true;` between the curly braces `{ }` and then click the **Check** button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say **SUBMIT FINAL**. Click it and see what happens.
