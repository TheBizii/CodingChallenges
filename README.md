# Coding challenges repository
This repository currently contains **123** solved challenge(s), all solved using a C++ language.

## File naming convention
There are two files that each task has. The first one is a file that contains instructions and ends with .md. The second file contains source code (solution) of the task. Files are named in a simple way. File that contains instructions has a name that contains the name of the task with a language code appended (mostly _en [for English] and _sl [for Slovenian]). Source code file is named after the task and does not have anything else appended to it.
