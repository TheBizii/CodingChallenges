# Greetings!

Now that Snapchat and Slingshot are soooo 2018, the teenagers of the world have all switched to the new hot app called BAPC (Bidirectional and Private Communication). This app has some stricter social rules than previous iterations. For example, if someone says goodbye using _Later!_, the other person is expected to reply with _Alligator!_. You can not keep track of all these social conversations and decide to automate any necessary responses, starting with the most important one: the greetings. When your conversational partner opens with _he...ey_, you have to respond with _hee...eey_ as well, but using twice as many _e_'s!

Given a string of the form _he...ey_ of length at most 1000, print the greeting you will respond with, but using twice as many _e_'s.
