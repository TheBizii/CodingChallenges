# Oddities

Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number **3** is odd, because it is not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are not odd, they are even. More precisely, if a number _**n**_ can be expressed as `n = 2 * k` for some integer _**k**_, then _**n**_ is even. For example, `6 = 2 * 3` is even.

Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or even. To see a common example, do an internet search for the query “is zero even or odd?” (Don’t search for this now! You have a problem to solve!)

Write a program to help these confused people.

## Input

Input begins with an integer **1** ≤ _**n**_ ≤ **20** on a line by itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each of the following _**n**_ lines contain a test case consisting of a single integer **−10** ≤ _**x**_ ≤ **10**.

## Output

For each _**x**_, print either ‘x is odd’ or ‘x is even’ depending on whether _**x**_ is odd or even.

## Examples
