In the popular show “Dinner for Five”, five contestants compete in preparing culinary delights. Every evening one of them makes dinner and each of other four then grades it on a scale from 1 to 5. The number of points a contestant gets is equal to the sum of grades they got. The winner of the show is of course the contestant that gets the most points.

Write a program that determines the winner and how many points they got.

## Input

Five lines, each containing 4 integers, the grades a contestant got. The contestants are numbered 1 to 5 in the order in which their grades were given.

## Output

Output on a single line the winner’s number and their points, separated by a space. The input data will guarantee that the solution is unique.
