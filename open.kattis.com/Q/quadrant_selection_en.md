# Quadrant Selection

A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given points lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below:

For example, the point _**A**_, which is at coordinates (12, 5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its _**x**_ and _**y**_ values are positive, and point _**B**_ lies in quadrant 2 since its _**x**_ value is negative and its _**y**_ value is positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.

## Input

The first line of input contains the integer _**x**_ (**-1000** <= _**x**_ <= **1000**; _**x**_ != 0). The second line of input contains the integer _**y**_ (**-1000** <= _**y**_ <= **1000**; _**y**_ != 0).

## Output

Output the quadrant number (1, 2, 3 or 4), for the point (_**x**_, _**y**_).
