# Last Factorial Digit

The factorial of _**N**_, written as _**N!**_, is defined as the product of all the integers from **1** to _**N**_. For example, **3!** = **1** x **2** x **3** = **6**.

This number can be very large, so instead of computing the entire product, just compute the last digit of _**N!**_ (when _**N!**_ is written in base 10).

## Input

The first line of input contains a positive integer **1** ≤ _**T**_ ≤ **10**, the number of test cases. Each of the next _**T**_ lines contains a single positive integer _**N**_. _**N**_ is at most **10**.

## Output

For each value of _**N**_, print the last digit of _**N!**_.

## Examples

Sample Input | Sample Output
-|-
`3`<br>`1`<br>`2`<br>`3` | `1`<br>`2`<br>`6`
`2`<br>`5`<br>`2` | `0`<br>`2`
