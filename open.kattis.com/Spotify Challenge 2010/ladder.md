# Ladder

You are attempting to climb up the roof to fix some leaks, and have to go buy a ladder. The ladder needs to reach to the top of the wall, which is _**h**_ centimeters high, and in order to be steady enough for you to climb it, the ladder can be at an angle of at most _**v**_ degrees from the ground. How long does the ladder have to be?

## Input

The input consists of a single line containing two integers _**h**_ and _**v**_, with meanings as described above. You may assume that **1** ≤ _**h**_ ≤ **10 000** and that **1** ≤ _**v**_ ≤ **89**.

## Output

Write a single line containing the minimum possible length of the ladder in centimeters, rounded up to the nearest integer.
