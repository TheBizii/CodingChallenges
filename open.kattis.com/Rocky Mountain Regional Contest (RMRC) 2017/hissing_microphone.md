# Hissing Microphone

A known problem with some microphones is the "hissing s". That is, sometimes the sound of letter s is particularly pronounced; it stands out from the rest of the word in an unpleasant way.

Of particular annoyance are words that contain the letter s twice in a row. Words like _amiss_, _kiss_, _mississippi_ and even _hiss_ itself.

## Input

The input contains a single string on a single line. This string consists of only lowercase letters (no spaces) and has between 1 and 30 characters.

## Output

Output a single line. If the input string contains two consecutive occurences of the letter _s_, then output _hiss_. Otherwise, output _no hiss_.

## Examples

Sample Input | Sample Output
-|-
`amiss` | `hiss`
`octopuses` | `no hiss`
`hiss` | `hiss`
